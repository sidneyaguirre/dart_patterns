Dart3 Patterns 

## Pattern

A pattern represents a structure that one or more values can take, like a blueprint.
Patterns compare against actual values determine if they -match-

Some patterns, when they match, -destructure- the matched value by pulling data out of it.
Destructuring lets you unpack values from an object to assign them to local variables, or perform further matching on them.
